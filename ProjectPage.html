        <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right w3-text-light-grey">Financial Modeling & Analysis in Excel</span>Valuation Model</p>
        <p>
            Created a valuation model of Amazon Inc. Together with two other team members, we performed research in order to forecast Amazon's cash flows
            and then used our model to discount these cash flows to find a company value.

        <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right w3-text-light-grey">Database Management</span>Functional Database Final Project</p>
        <p>
            With a team of 5 other students, we created a database for a hypothetical local charity. My main responsibilities on the project were to create the entity framework
            and to ensure that our data was functional and valid. I also participated in the creation of SQL queries in order to provide feedback to our clients questions.

        <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right w3-text-light-grey">Student Investment Fund</span>Company Valuation</p>
        <p>
            I am a participant in the Fall 2020 Price College of Business Student Investment Fund. We manage a small-cap value fund that currently sits at a value around $1,000,000.
            Along with one partner, I manage the energy sector of this fund. Our main resposnibility has been to forecast our current and potential holding's revenue and cash flows.
            We then use these forecasts to find a value for each company. We then use our valuations to make investment decisions.

        <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right w3-text-light-grey">Racon Natural Resources SPAC</span>Valuation Model</p>
        <p>
            This past summer, I had the opportunity to work for a SPAC in the early stages. My main responsibility was to create a cash flow model in Excel to valuate potential aquisitional targets.
            In total, I valuated 6 different assets. I utilized data from Enverus DrillinInfo to forecast Oil & Gas production. These models were made with high functionality and the ability to quickly change
            inputs based on management preference.

        <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right w3-text-light-grey">Intro to Marketing - Vichy, France</span>Whisperies Consulting Project</p>
        <p>
            While studying abroad with the University of Oklahoma in Vichy, France, I participated in a consulting project with a local company. Whisperies was considering entering the
            U.S. market with their children's books. Our team performed in-depth research on the children's book market in the U.S. and eventually gave our reccommnedation that they should
            not attempt to enter market.
